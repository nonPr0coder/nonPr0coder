# About me

I'm an office guy working in the legal field who's self-taught in coding. When it comes to computers, I'm only expected to know how to use Access and Excel, so maybe I'm not able to create the most beautiful code.

I'm just trying to create or collaborate on solutions that I feel I need in my daily routine, with good intentions.
